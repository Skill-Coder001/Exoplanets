        <p>What is an exoplanet?</p>
        <br>
        <p>An exoplanet is any planet beyond our solar system. 
            Most orbit other stars, but free-floating exoplanets, called rogue planets, orbit the galactic center and are untethered to any star.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>When were the first exoplanets discovered?</p>
        <br>
        <p>The first exoplanets were discovered in the 1990s and since then we’ve identified thousands using a variety of detection methods. It’s pretty rare for astronomers to see an exoplanet through their telescopes the way you might see Saturn through a telescope from Earth. That’s called direct imaging, and only a handful of exoplanets have been found this way (and these tend to be young gas giant planets orbiting very far from their stars).</p>    
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>What is the closest exoplanet to earth?</p>
        <br>
        <p>At only four light-years away, Proxima Centauri b is our closest known exoplanet neighbor. 
            Proxima b is a super Earth exoplanet that orbits a M-type star. 
            Its mass is 1.27 Earths, it takes 11.2 days to complete one orbit of its star, and is 0.0485 AU from its star.</p>
